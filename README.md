A web platform for adopting pets. Its purpose is to simplify the adoption process and also to help pets to find new home faster. There are two types of users in the application - shelters and adopters. Shelters can register by sending a form that should be approved by administrator. The applicant receive a notification for their application status. Adopters registration is easier, they just need to fill a form. Shelter can add ads in which should fill information about the pet. Adopter, on the other side, should fill a adoption form in case he want's to become the new owner of the pet. The adoption application is send to the shelter and he can either aprove it or decline it. If the adoption application is accepted, pet ad is no longer visible on the site and if there are other adoption applications for the current pet, they are declined. The users get a notification if their adoption application is accepted or declined. Shelters also get a notification if there is a new application for adopting a pet. For every shelter there is a page where information is kept about all of their pets - adopted, deleted and active ads. In addition to approving or declining adoption requests, administrator can delete or edit pet ads. Changing ads by administrator sent a notification to the shelter - owner of the pet.
